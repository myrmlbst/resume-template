# Resume Template

This repository contains a LaTeX template for a resume for someone in the field of software engineering (or any adjacent field).
It is created with two things in mind:

1. **ATS-Friendliness;** to bypass the initial ATS stage.
2. **Proper fromatting for HR revision;** to properly structure the document in a way that highlights the candidate's strengths and experiences to a human reviewer.

This template is under the MIT License, making it free and open to be used by anyone.

## Prerequisites:

Install a LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX), or create an Overleaf account. Then, you can customize the content under each section (skills, experience, projects, education), and/or modify the styling, fonts, or colors as needed.
